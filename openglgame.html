										This project was done for the Object-oriented programming + Rendering exam. 
										This code is entirely written in <b>C++</b> and uses <b>OpenGL</b> library.
										This game consists in a timed race. The goal is to complete 4 laps as quickly as possible.
										<br>To develop this game, I created some 3D models with Blender and used some free ones found online (like environment).
										I defined a class for the kart that contains informations about dimension and position. 
										The movement of the kart is determinated with <b>uniformly accelerated motion</b>.
										To check collision, I created a bounding box and invisible walls.
										For each recursion, I checked the intesection with a simple calculation.
										I implemented a <b>shader</b> with a purely diffusive brdf with bright colors to make the atmosphere of the cartoon. 
										I also added some reflective elements (like coins and the engine) and a <b>shadow mapping</b>.
										I used a Sky-Box as background.
